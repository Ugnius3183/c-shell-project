C Shell Command Line Interface

The following commands are available in this shell:

cd [path]
    Change the current working directory to the specified path.
    If no path is specified, the home directory is used.

clr
    Clear the terminal screen.

dir [path]
    List the contents of the specified directory.
    If no path is specified, the current directory is used.

environ
    Print all environment strings.

echo [message]
    Echo the specified message to the terminal.
    If no message is specified, a blank line is printed.

help
    Display this user manual.

pause
    Pause the operation of the shell until you press ENTER.

quit
    Quit the shell.

Usage:
    To use a command, simply type its name followed by any necessary arguments.
    To quit the shell, type "quit".

Environment:
    A programming environment is a tool that programmers use which provides the necessary
    infrastructure needed for programming code. Environments contain text editors, compilers
    or interpretters, and debuggers necessary to the production of code and the ability
    to test code.

I/O Redirection:
    Allows control over where standard input, standard output, and standard error
    streams are piped. Allows to optimize a program's workflow for more efficient
    productivity.

    Usage:
        "<" inputfile - Redirects input from command line to file
        ">" outputfile - Redirects output from the terminal to file
        ">>" outputfile - Redirects and appends output from the terminal to existing file. Creates new file if one does not exists.

Process:
    A process is a currently running instance of a program. Any command that is executed starts a
    process and will persist until the program reaches its end or is manually stopped by a keyboard
    interrupt.

    Types of processes:
        Foreground process - A process that runs on the terminal it was executed on, the process must finished before running additional commands
        Background process - A process that runs in the background, freeing up the terminal to be used for additional commands

    Usage:
        command[&] - Runs specified command in background
